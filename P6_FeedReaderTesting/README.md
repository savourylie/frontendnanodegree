# Feed Reader Project with Testing
This is Feed Reader app that gets news feed from four different news sources.
## Installation
Installation is not required. Simply open the index.html with any browser to start using it.

## How it works
Simply click on the news sources on the sidebar to load the latest feeds from them. After the feeds are loaded, click on the articles that interest you and it'll take you to that article! It's that simple!

## Tests
The most essential features of the app are tested using the Jasmine BDD framework. What follows outline the main tests written for this app:

#### Testing that the feeds are good to go, which includes
* the feeds are well-defined
* the URLs are non-empty
* the names are non-empty

#### The sidebar is RWD and works properly, which includes
* the sidebar is hidden by default
* the sidebar shows up when you click on the hamburger icon

#### The entry column is not empty on load, which means
* there is at least a single article present

#### When you select a new feed, the entry column changes accordingly, which means
* when a new feed is loaded, the content actually changes
