# Neighbourhood Map Project
A map that shows you the cool places in your area.

## Installation
Installation is not required. Simply open the index.html with any browser to start using it.

## How it works
Upon opening the app a Google Map will show markers of places around where the developer lives. Click on the markers and more information about the places will be revealed from a pop up infoWindow on the map.

On the side there's a side bar showing the names of the same places. On top of the side bar there's a search field where you can type to see the places of your interest, filtering out other places.

The place names on the side bar are clickable too and the same infoWindows will pop up on the map.
