# Neighbourhood Map Project
A map that shows you the cool places in your area.

## Installation
Installation is not required. Simply open the index.html with any browser to start using it.

## How it works
Upon opening the app a Google Map will show markers of places around where the developer lives. Click on the markers and more information about the places will be revealed from a pop up infoWindow on the map.

On the side there's a side bar showing the names of the same places. On top of the side bar there's a search field where you can type to see the places of your interest, filtering out other places.

The place names on the side bar are clickable too and the same infoWindows will pop up on the map.

## To-do List for Project Resummision
### Interface
1. I recommend to autohide list if infowindow is opened in mobile view. Currently infoWindow is not completely visible due to opened list

### App Functionality
N/A

### App Architecture (DOES NOT MEET REQUIREMENT!)
* **You should use Knockout bindings (not JQuery) where it is possible to manipulate DOM objects. See Code Review page for more details.**

* Student incorporates a build process allowing for production quality, minified code, to be delivered to the client.

* Data persists when the app is closed and reopened, either through localStorage or an external database (e.g. Firebase).

* In lieu of hardcoding locations, student populates a dynamic model with information retrieved from an API.

### Asynchronous Data Usage (DOES NOT MEET REQUIREMENT!)
* **Google Map API asynchronous loading and error handling should be updated a little bit. (See Code Review Section)**

### Filter Functionality
* Can be improved with an additaional autocomplete functionality. See:
