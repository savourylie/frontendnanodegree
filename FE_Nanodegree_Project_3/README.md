# Frogger Clone’s README
## Synopsis
This is a JavaScript clone of the classic arcade game—Frogger. The player controls the little guy to try to get to the other side of the screen while avoiding the enemies.
## Motivation
This is a coursework of the Front-end Nanodegree of Udacity.
## Installation
This is a browser game so no installation is needed. Simply open index.html with any browser that supports HTML5 and you're good to go.
## Control
Use the arrow keys to control the little guy at the bottom of the screen. The game resets when the little guy gets to the river or when he gets hit by an enemy.
